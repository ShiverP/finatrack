# finatrack
## FinaTrack is a tool that tracks your finances in as much or as little detail as you like. Simply want to see a gross overview of your income and expenses? Done. Want every last transaction to be traceable in the most detail available? Done also.

Currently starting with Kotlin, so it'll take a while before anything useful pops up.
